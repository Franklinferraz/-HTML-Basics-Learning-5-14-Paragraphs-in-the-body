Paragraphs in the body

Great job! To review, an HTML file has both a head and a body. 
The head is where you put information about your HTML file, like its title.

The body is where you put your content, such as text, images, and links.
The content in the body is what will be visible on the actual page.

The body goes inside the <html> tags, right after the <head> tags, like this:

<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Webpage</title>
  </head>

  <body>
  </body>
</html>

Instructions
Underneath the closing </head> tag, put an opening <body> tag and a closing </body> tag, like in the example above.
Inside the body, create two paragraphs. Each paragraph starts with an opening <p> tag and ends with a closing <p> tag. 
We can write content in between the tags, like this:
<body>
    <p>Hello world!</p>
</body>

Hint
Your code should loook something like this:

<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Webpage</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <p>This is my first paragraph</p>
    <p>This is my second paragraph</p>
  </body>
</html>
